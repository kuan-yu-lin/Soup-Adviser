## Project Information

### Description

Soup ADVISER is a dialog system, and it is built based on the ADVISER 2.0 toolkit. It is designed for users who need a soup recipe to deal with hunger. Users can ask for a recipe with the name of the soup, with the time they have to cook, or with the ingredients they have in hand. Further, users can ask for the cooking steps or the all the necessary ingredients after Soup ADVISER suggests one recipe for users.  

### Database

Recipes were sourced from [Comfortable Food](https://comfortablefood.com/35-easy-soup-recipes-with-few-ingredients/) and adapted to meet the requirements for the project.
